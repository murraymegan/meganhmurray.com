Hello! I amPhD candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University. I have a Bachelor's in Mathematics from Baylor University. In January of 2020 I married the love of my life Paul, shown in the photo on this page. We live in a quiet neighborhood in Nashville with our pet Beagle, Moxi. 

My research interests include false discovery rates, machine learning, and data science. Currently I am working under the advisement of Dr. Jeffrey D. Blume on multiple projects including racial disparities in lung cancer diagnosis and treatment.
