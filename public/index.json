These two topics became of interest to me after reading a paper published in April 2018 Nature Methods Journal titled ?Statistics versus machine learning? by Bzdok, Altman, and Brzywinski (Bzdok et al., 2018). The authors advocated for machine learning techniques for large-scale inference, as opposed to traditional statistical methods, which generated a great deal of discussion in the statistics community. I decided to replicate and explore their methods to determine for myself if the comparisons were fair or not. I presented my findings from this project at ENAR 2019. During the coding and computation of these methods I discovered, the popular R function stats::p.adjust did not always return the desired values and did not correctly account for missing values. After researching the available options, I decided to create my own R package for false discovery rate (FDR) estimation. The package is now complete and Professor Jeffrey Blume and I have a corresponding paper that explains our methods and illustrates the package. The paper is in the process of being submitted to The R Journal. My orals will focus on the methodology used in the ENAR presentation and in the R package. Dr. Greevy has agreed that, in combination, these two documents can serve as my oral exam preparation. This document will provide a short introduction to these topics.

Without engaging underrepresented groups, precision medicine could not only fail to achieve its promise but also further exacerbate the health disparities already burdening the most vulnerable. Yet underrepresentation by people of non-European ancestry continues in precision medicine research and there are disparities across racial groups in the uptake of precision medicine applications and services. Studies have explored possible explanations for population differences in precision medicine participation, but full appreciation of the factors involved is still developing. To better inform the potential for addressing health disparities through PM, we assessed the relationship of precision medicine knowledge and trust in biomedical research with sociodemographic variables. Using a series of linear regression models applied to survey data collected in a diverse sample, we analyzed variation in both precision medicine knowledge and trust in biomedical research with socioeconomic factors as a way to understand the range of precision medicine knowledge (PMK) in a broadly representative group and its relationship to trust in research and demographic characteristics. Our results demonstrate that identifying as Black, while significantly PMK, explains only 1.5% of the PMK variance in unadjusted models and 7% of overall variance in models adjusted for meaningful covariates such as age, marital status, employment, and education. We also found a positive association between PMK and trust in biomedical research. These results indicate that race is a factor affecting PMK, even after accounting for differences in sociodemographic variables. Additional work is needed, however, to identify other factors contributing to variation in PMK as we work to increase diversity and inclusion in precision medicine applications.","tags":["PMK","Precision Medicine","Health Disparities"],"title":"Factors Influencing Precision Medicine Knowledge and Attitudes","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572048000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572048000,"objectID":"fa4665ee521aa7e2dedf7f64395301f8","permalink":"www.meganhmurray.com/talk/acts2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.meganhmurray.com/talk/acts2019/","section":"talk","summary":"2019 beamer poster presentation for ACTS conference.","tags":["Multiple Testing","Machine Learning"],"title":"An evaluation of machine learning and classical statistical methods for discovery in large-scale translational data","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552176000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552176000,"objectID":"53aa45d5d10b6b9c4527367e45b04e14","permalink":"www.meganhmurray.com/talk/enar2019/","publishdate":"2019-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.meganhmurray.com/talk/enar2019/","section":"talk","summary":"2019 beamer slides for ENAR conference.","tags":["Multiple Testing","Machine Learning"],"title":"An evaluation of machine learning and classical statistical methods for discovery in large-scale translational data","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1492646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1492646400,"objectID":"cff4b9cc683314cc4757f8a4e22e44ba","permalink":"www.meganhmurray.com/talk/undergradthesis/","publishdate":"2017-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.meganhmurray.com/talk/undergradthesis/","section":"talk","summary":"For two semesters, a fellow math major and I thoroughly proved results from Sections 1.1 -- 1.8 of An Introduction to Chaotic Dynamical Systems by Robert Devaney. After going through Devaney's calculations and proofs, I created a multi-parameter family of functions to consider and observe. This is a piecewise function of polynomials that always intersects the x-axis at 0 and 1. It has two maxima and one minimum value. Depending on the range of the parameters, the minimum value can be above or below the x-axis. I have analyzed its behavior and determined the fixed and periodic points. I found that at certain parameter values the family of function's corresponding invariant set will be closed and totally disconnected. I conjecture that the invariant set is a perfect subset of the unit interval which would make it a Cantor set. Next, if the same parameter values could be used to show the new equation maps are chaotic. Dr. Brian Raines will guide me through the steps of this process.
