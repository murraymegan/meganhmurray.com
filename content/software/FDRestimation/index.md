summary: Estimate, Plot, and Summarize False Discovery Rates
abstract: "The user can directly compute and display false discovery rates from inputted p-values or z-scores under a variety of assumptions. `p.fdr()` computes FDRs, adjusted p-values and decision reject vectors from inputted p-values or z-values. `get.pi0()` estimates the proportion of data that are truly null. `plot.p.fdr()` plots the FDRs, adjusted p-values, and the raw p-values points against their rejection threshold lines."
